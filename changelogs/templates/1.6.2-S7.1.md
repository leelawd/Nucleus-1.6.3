# IMPORTANT: Deprecation of GeoIP module

GeoIP will be removed from Nucleus in 1.7. This is due to low usage and the fact it isn't really considered "essential". However, do not fret, as 
Nucleus Heisenberg replaces the GeoIP module with equal functionality.

I am having difficulties with Ore at the moment and as such, Heisenberg has not been fully published on Ore. It will be resolved soon and available
on Ore ASAP.

Note that the Warning and Server Shop modules will be removed in due course when suitable replacements have been written or found.

# New Features

* Added `-a` command flag to `/clearinventory` to clear everything
* Added `NucleusClearInventoryEvent`s for other plugins to hook into.
* Added ability to add co-ordinates to `/blockinfo`

# Bug fixes

* Changed behaviour when a first spawn point could not be used for new players, will now fall back to other spawn options rather than the
default world spawn point.
