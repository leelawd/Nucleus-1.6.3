## New features

* `/list` can now display any templated string like chat, see `playerinfo.list.template`
* Group aliases will now be coloured if ampersand formatted.

## Minor changes

Removed `kits.separate-permissions` config entry, it is now always true. 
Use `nucleus.kits` permission to emulate `false`.

## API updates

Added HelpOp message channel

## Bugfixes

* Fix world deletion for custom paths
* Remove world corrector for UUID repair (it didn't properly work)
* Fix text parser sometimes dropping colours
* Fix message module not reloading when asked to

## Known Issues

* Sometimes, an incorrect custom prefix might be selected. Nucleus uses whatever the permission plugin hands back, check your inheritance with the permissions plugin.
